## About

A todo list that can auto-categorize items into one of four categories. Users can view their todo list items by category, mark them as complete and change the category of an item manually. (Images Below!)


## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference.
2. Install dependencies: `npm i`
3. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
4. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
5. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
6. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`
